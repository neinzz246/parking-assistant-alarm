Parking Assistant Alarm

A simple Arduino-based parking assistant system that helps drivers park safely by detecting obstacles and giving audio or visual alerts. This project is ideal for learning about ultrasonic sensors, buzzer alerts, and real-time distance measurement.

Components Needed

Arduino Uno (or compatible)

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

Buzzer (piezo or active)

Breadboard & jumper wires

Power supply (5V from Arduino or external)

Working Principle

Ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance from obstacles behind the vehicle.

Arduino processes the sensor data in real-time.

When an object comes within a threshold distance:

Buzzer emits beeps (faster as the vehicle gets closer).

The system provides a simple audible and/or visual alert to prevent collisions while parking.
